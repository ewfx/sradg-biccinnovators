## 🎯 Introduction
## Smarter Reconciliation and Anomaly Detection using Gen AI

We, as participants, are addressing the challenge of manual anomaly detection in reconciliation processes. Our goal is to leverage AI for real-time identification of irregularities, reducing human error and accelerating the entire workflow.

### Problem Statement
Current reconciliation systems rely heavily on manual oversight, leading to delays and potential inaccuracies. By integrating AI-driven solutions, we aim to provide immediate alerts on anomalies, offer root-cause analysis, and streamline reconciliation tasks.

### Proposed Approach
•	Leverage AI Models: Utilize LLMs (e.g., GPT, LLaMA, Falcon) to detect anomalies and categorize them based on historical patterns.

•	Clustering & Analysis: Implement clustering algorithms and advanced anomaly detection techniques to reveal hidden data insights.

•	Interactive Feedback: Develop a mechanism for reconcilers to confirm or refute detected anomalies, continually refining AI accuracy.

## 💡 Inspiration
We were inspired by the inefficiencies in manual reconciliation processes, which are time-consuming and prone to human errors. Our project aims to automate anomaly detection using GenAI, providing real-time alerts, root-cause analysis, and improved accuracy to streamline financial reconciliation workflows.

## ⚙️ What It Does
Our project includes the following key features and functionalities:

#### Anomaly Detection – Identifies anomalies using both historical and real-time reconciliation data.

#### Anomaly Classification – Categorizes detected anomalies into predefined buckets for better understanding.

#### AI-Powered Resolution Summaries – Generates AI-driven insights to assist in anomaly resolution.

#### LLM-Enhanced Detection & Categorization – Utilizes LLM models to improve anomaly identification and classification accuracy.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
Technologies, Frameworks, and Tools Used -

ML & GenAI – Detect anomalies and provide insights into potential root causes.

Programming Language – Python for model development and API deployment.

Frameworks & Libraries – Flask (API deployment), LangChain (LLM integration), Pandas (data processing), Scikit-learn (anomaly detection), Hugging Face (AI-driven insights).
